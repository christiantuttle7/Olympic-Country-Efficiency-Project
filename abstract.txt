This project investigates the application of machine learning to analyze and predict athletic success using the "Olympic Efficiency" dataset. Utilizing the Python programming language alongside libraries such as Scikit-Learn and Pandas, a predictive model was developed to evaluate metrics correlating with high-efficiency ratings across diverse Olympic disciplines. The methodology included exploratory data analysis to handle outliers, feature engineering to scale athlete metrics, and the implementation of regression algorithms. Specifically, a Random Forest Regressor was trained and optimized using K-fold cross-validation to ensure reliable performance on unseen data and to extract precise feature importances. The resulting model successfully identified the primary drivers of athletic performance, revealing that a country's Olympic efficiency and overall medal count are most heavily influenced by its GDP per capita. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the efficacy of computational modeling in sports analytics, providing a data-driven framework for understanding how national socioeconomic factors impact international athletic competitiveness.
